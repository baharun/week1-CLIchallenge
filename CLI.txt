1.  How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?
To create a hidden file or folder add a dot (.) at the beginning of the name.
Example: (touch .RUN.txt) or (mkdir .RUN)
To Display the hidden file in CLI you should use the command (ls –a)
2. How do I create multiple nested directories?
Add –p before the command mkdir.
Example: mkdir –p bahar/run/week1
3. How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character?
Use the command (echo “message” >> filename.txt)

Note: I think there is another answer to Q1.
to make a file hidden, first you should create the file using command (mkdir) after that by using command (attrib +h +r +s filename) the file will be hidden.
after that if you use the command (ls), you can see the file is listed. For making the file unhidden, you should use command (attrib -h -r -s filename).
